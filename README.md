# Dimension-Reduction-and-Clustering-Analysis
Perform PCA, Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and K-medoids clustering using Gower distance on mixed data

The project is to predict the house sale price. There are two methods explored to perform prediction.

Part 1- Dimension reduction: The method used in this part involves using different dimension reduction techniques for numerical and categorical featues and building linear regression model with ridge regularization. The model results are then compared with base model to test the performance.

Part 2: Clustering Analysis The method in this part clusterings analysis with numerical and categorical data combined. Gower distance metric is used to measure the distance. The Gower distance is essentially a special distance metric that measures numerical data and categorical data separately, then combine them to form a distance calculation.

Data for the project is taken from below website:
